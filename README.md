## Mission Summary

The primary mission objective of our CanSat is to deploy a payload from the container at a predetermined altitude, collect scientific data during descent, ensure the egg payload, point the camera position, and ensure the safe recovery of the payload. We have chosen to attempt the selectable objective, which involves measuring atmospheric pressure, temperature, and capturing images during descent. The rationale for this selection is based on the scientific value of the data and the feasibility of integrating the required sensors within the payload constraints.

## System Requirement Summary

The CanSat system must meet several high-level requirements to ensure mission success:

- **Deployment:** The CanSat must deploy from the launch vehicle at a specified altitude without mechanical failures.
- **Descent Control:** The descent rate must be controlled to ensure data collection and safe landing.
- **Data Acquisition:** The payload must collect atmospheric data (pressure, temperature) and capture images during descent.
- **Recovery:** The payload must be recoverable and intact after landing.
- **Communication:** The CanSat must transmit data to the ground station in real-time.

## System Level Configuration Trade & Selection

We considered two preliminary system-level concepts for our CanSat design:

1. **Concept A:** A streamlined cylindrical container with a deployable parachute for descent control and a payload equipped with multiple sensors and a camera.
2. **Concept B:** A modular container with detachable sections, each equipped with independent descent control mechanisms.

After evaluating the concepts based on criteria such as weight, cost, ease of assembly, and reliability, we selected Concept A. The streamlined design reduces aerodynamic drag and simplifies the deployment mechanism, making it more reliable.

## Physical Layout

The physical layout of the selected CanSat configuration includes:

- **Container Dimensions:** _Specified at PDR_
- **Payload Components:** Sensors, camera, data acquisition system, and descent control mechanisms.
- **Sensor Placement:** Strategically placed to optimize data collection during descent.
- **Power Supply:** Batteries housed within the payload to power all electronic components.

## System Concept of Operations (CONOPS)

The CanSat operations can be divided into three main phases:

1. **Launch and Deployment:**
   - The CanSat is integrated into the launch vehicle.
   - At the target altitude, the container is deployed, and the payload begins its descent.

2. **Descent Operations:**
   - The parachute deploys to control the descent rate.
   - Sensors collect atmospheric data, and the camera captures images.
   - Data is transmitted to the ground station in real-time.

3. **Recovery and Data Analysis:**
   - The payload lands safely.
   - The team retrieves the payload and downloads any stored data.
   - Data is analyzed to meet mission objectives and verify system performance.

## Launch Vehicle Compatibility

The CanSat must fit within the payload section of the launch vehicle. Our design ensures clearances are maintained, and no sharp protrusions exist that could hinder deployment. We have included a dimensioned drawing to demonstrate the fit and ensure compatibility.

## Sensor Subsystem Design

The sensor subsystem includes the following components:

- **Air Pressure Sensor:** Measures atmospheric pressure during descent.
- **Air Temperature Sensor:** Records temperature variations.
- **GPS Sensor:** Tracks the CanSat's location.
- **Camera:** Captures images of the descent and landing area.
- **Battery Voltage Sensor:** Monitors the power supply status.

## Trade Studies and Selection

For each sensor, we conducted trade studies to evaluate different models based on interfaces, resolution, cost, size, weight, and other relevant factors. The selected sensors are:

- **Air Pressure Sensor:** BME-280 & ASPD-4525, chosen for its high resolution and reliability.
- **Air Temperature Sensor:** BME-280, selected for its accuracy and compact size.
- **GPS Sensor:** Ublox NEO-M8N, chosen for its robust performance and ease of integration.
- **Camera:** Raspberry PI Camera V1.3, selected for its high-resolution imaging capabilities.
- **Battery Voltage Sensor:** Microcontroller A0 (Analog Pin), chosen for its precise monitoring capabilities.

## Descent Control Design

The descent control system (DCS) is critical for ensuring the payload's safe descent and landing. Our design includes:

- **Parachute:** A lightweight, deployable parachute that ensures a controlled descent rate.
- **Aerobraking Mechanisms:** Deployed to stabilize the payload during descent and reduce terminal velocity.
- **Payload Uprighting Mechanisms:** Ensure the payload lands in an upright position for optimal data collection post-landing.

## Mechanical Subsystem Design

The mechanical subsystem encompasses the structural elements of both the container and the payload:

- **Container Structure:** Durable materials chosen for their strength-to-weight ratio, ensuring protection during launch and deployment.
- **Payload Structure:** Compact and robust design to house all sensors and electronic components securely.
- **Attachment Mechanisms:** Securely mount sensors, batteries, and other components to withstand the forces experienced during launch and descent.

## Conclusion

Our CanSat project embodies a comprehensive approach to meeting the CanSat 2024 competition requirements. Through meticulous design, rigorous trade studies, and thorough testing, we aim to achieve mission success and contribute valuable scientific data. The detailed design considerations and subsystem integrations outlined in this document demonstrate our team's commitment to excellence in engineering and innovation in the field of small satellite systems.
